                         Wilson loop computation

********************************************************************************


WILSON LOOPS

The programs compute rectangular Wilson loops on imported gauge configuration.
The links are smeared to (i) define a static action and (ii) to construct an
operator basis which results in a Wilson loop correlation matrix. See

for details.

The currently supported boundary conditions are periodic and open. For a
description of how-to run the program and the output see the README in the
main subdirectory. 


PROGRAM FEATURES

All programs parallelize in 0,1,2,3 or 4 dimensions, depending on what is
specified at compilation time.


OPENQCD PACKAGE

All programs use the openQCD package modules as library. The package has to
be present at compile time in a directory to be specified in the Makefile.
The currently supported version is openQCD-1.4.


COMPILATION

The compilation of the programs is in accordance with openQCD-1.4. See there for
details.


AUTHORS

The initial release of the wloop package was written by Bj√∂rn Leder. Initial
support for open boundary conditions was added by Jacob Finkenrath.


ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

An early version of the code is based on a Wilson loop program by Nazario Tantalo.
