Programs for the smearing module.

check1        Direct check of the HYP-smearing routines.

check2        Check of the hyp_links (SU(3) normalization).

check3        Check of hyp_links - ape_links equivalence.

time1         Timing of the smearing routines.

The programs check2, check3, time1 accept the option -bc <type> that allows the
type of boundary condition to be chosen at runtime. When the option is not
set, open boundary conditions are assumed.
