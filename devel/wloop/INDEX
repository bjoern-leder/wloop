Check programs for Wilson loops programs


check1   Simple check and timing off the Wilson loops routine.

check2   Gauge invariance check on the wloops routines.

check3   Translational invariance check on the wloops routines.

The programs check1, ..., check3 accept the option -bc <type> that allows the
type of boundary condition to be chosen at runtime. When the option is not
set, open boundary conditions are assumed.
